            <p>Babyyy I'm so glad that we're together for three whole months now, I really can't believe it. I'm so happy that I've made it this far with you and the fact that its you makes me even more happier. I don't think i could be with anyone for  this long which is why this is so special to me.. You're the best girlfriend I've ever had and I mean that, you know how to take care of me and you know what makes me happy. When I'm feeling sad you always know how to put a smile on my face which no one is ever able to do.. you're like my happy place. Whenever I don't feel good I know I can rely on you to make me feel better and you've made me a much better person because of it. I wouldn't have been able to quit my bad habits like smoking and drinking if it wasn't for you, you're my motivation for all of these things and I strive to become a better person because I want to be a better man for you. Everytime I see your pretty face my heart starts to beat twice as fast and it feels like it's doing front flips which I never really felt before. Everything about your appearance is so beautiful.. your eyes are so mesmerising I wish I could stare into them forever. Your hair looks so gorgeous and so many different colors suit you baby, I always think about playing with your hair and spoiling you with affection 24/7. If there was one thing I could change about this relationship it would be that we weren't so far away from each other because it pains me so much that I have the prettiest, funniest and cutest girl in the world but I don't even get to hold her. Sometimes I think that going through all this long distance stuff is what makes me realise that my love for you is real and it isn't just some silly obsession or lust.. I am willing to wait as long as it takes to be able to finally hold you in my arms and attack you with a billion kisses whenever I feel like it. When we're together we are going to go on so many dates like the beach at night and the aquarium. We'll take pictures of us kissing next to the jellyfish!! When we go to the beach at night we can draw a heart and then our initals inside it. I know you already did that but it has more meaning to me when we both do it together!! I can't wait to live with you when we're older and have proper careers. I'll always put you before me baby and take care of you both mentally and physically. Also for some reason you're actually funny which I don't wanna admit but you are, your jokes make me laugh a lot and the random phrases you come up with every two weeks are so cute and funny I love them baby. I've never met such a sweet girl. I remember when we were just friends and texted each other about random shit, I never thought we would get this close it feels so weird because of how unexpected it was. Do NOT take that in a bad way though, I'm glad we love each other. You fill a hole in my heart and you made my life so much happier compared to before we got together. I always had this feeling of emptiness inside me and deep down I might be emotionally unstable, but after we got together and you showed me your love I have never felt better, I know we had some times where I would go crazy over dumb stuff and lose my mind and I'm sorry for that. I don't know how you put up with my bullshit sometimes, this is just another one of the 100 reasons as to why I think you're the best girlfriend ever. You're patient with me and I loved it so much when you comforted my during my panic attacks. I always dreamed about having someone to take care of me like this when I'm at the lowest and now you're here for that. You're literally a dream come true for me baby!! You're the only person I can see myself spending the rest of my life with. I love daydreaming about the future.. how  I'm gonna put a ring on your finger and see you in a wedding dress, throw a wedding then move to a new country to live there for the rest of our lives. We're definitely going to live with atleast two pets, maybe even kids. Our kids would be so perfect. I would love to be a father especially if the mother to my kids would be you baby. If it's not you then its no one. I love you my sweet girl.</p>
